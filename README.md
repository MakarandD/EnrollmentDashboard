## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8.0** - Latest stable .NET framework
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** - Web application framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for data access
- **xUnit** - Unit testing framework
- **Moq** - Mocking library for unit tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code
- SQL Server (LocalDB or Express)

### Building the Project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Or from the solution directory:

```bash
dotnet test EnrollmentDashboardApplication.Tests/EnrollmentDashboardApplication.Tests.csproj
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd EnrollmentDashboardApplication
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or the configured port).

## API Features

### **Dashboard** (`/Enrollments`)
   - List of enrollments (participant, program, date, status)
   - Summary statistics (total, active, completed, withdrawn)
   - Filter by date range

### **Detail View** (`/Enrollments/Details/{id}`)
   - Full enrollment information
   - Participant and program details
   - Notes (securely rendered)

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests using xUnit:

- **EnrollmentServiceTests** - Tests for enrollment business logic
  - Enrollment validation
  - Capacity checking
  - Student and course retrieval

Run tests with:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=EnrollmentDashboardApplication;Trusted_Connection=true;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Database persistence with Entity Framework Core
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Student progress tracking
- [ ] Course prerequisites
- [ ] Payment processing integration

## Review Comments
// Review Comment 1: The code uses string concatenation (+) to build the SQL query using raw user inputs (participantName, startDate, endDate). An attacker can manipulate these parameters to bypass authentication, extract sensitive database schema information, modify data, or execute remote commands ( Critical)

// Review Comment 2 : The Entity Framework method db.Database.SqlQuery<T>() accepts raw string commands. Passing an unvalidated concatenated string directly into this method execution introduces classic SQL injection risks ( High)

//Fix : for 1 and 2 user SQLParameters for adding records

// Review Comment 3: The controller accepts startDate and endDate as plain strings instead of strongly-typed DateTime objects. This allows attackers to inject malicious code payload strings instead of calendar dates (High)

// Fix : Use Strongly typed input parameters

// Review Comment 4: By using @Html.Raw(), you explicitly tell the Razor engine to disable its automatic built-in HTML encoding protection. If an attacker inputs a malicious JavaScript payload into the Notes field (e.g., during creation or edit), that script will execute directly in the browser of anyone viewing this dashboard. 
// Fix : <td>@enrollment.Notes</td>

// Review Comment 5 : The Details and Delete actions trust the incoming raw integer id string directly from the URL route query parameters (/Enrollments/Details?id=123). There are no security boundary validations confirming if the currently logged-in user actually owns or has permission to view that specific record.
// Fix : use [Authorize]

// 4 Tests have been addded and they are runnning successfully, please check the results.docx for output. These test cases have been added for security testing which was mentioned in requirement

// I have also attached Enrollment Dashboard UI, I have tried to cover maximum of Implementation with Best Practices and architectural Patterns. I am yet to finish whole implementation.

// Please feel free to add review comments to improve this code base

// Improvements which can be done in Future :
1) avoid using query string mechanism which I have done ( Important Change)
2) Use Authorization for login purpose
3) Make use of Observability tools to maintain codebase
4) Inclde Serilog, I have just referenced serilog but I have not implemented.
